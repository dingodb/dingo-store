# Submission Guidelines

As an open-source-oriented basic storage + computing platform, Dingo-Store should be designed and developed with more attention to detail in every aspect. Based on this principle, the following code submission guidelines are now defined:


# Commit Rules

```shell
[type][module] <description>
```

## 1. Specification parameter description

### 1.1 Rules

- Use [type in lowercase][module in lowercase] with capitalized first letter to describe the issue.
- If multiple modules are designed in a single submission, the final module should be the one with the highest modification weight.
- For proto-related interface submissions, they must be submitted separately.
- Ideally, each commit should only solve one problem, and it is recommended not to submit 100 files in a single commit.
